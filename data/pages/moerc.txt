                   Runtime Configuration file for Moe

 Moe looks for this file in:
	1 - $HOME/.moerc
	2 - ${sysconfdir}/moerc

 FIRST SECTION: Default editor options
 Put each option you want set in the first column.
 Editor options can be specified as "Default editor options" in this file,
 or as "editor options" on the command line.
 The command line options override those specified in this file.

	--auto-unmark	Turn off highlighting after block copy or move

	--no-backup	If you don't want backup files to be created

	--exit-ask	Save-and-close always asks for confirmation

	--ignore-case	Make search case insensitive by default

	--indent-step=2	Number of spaces to add when indenting a block.

	--keep-lines=-1	Number of lines to keep for PgUp/PgDn

	--max-windows=0	Max number of windows to show at once

	--orphan	Put extra files given on command line in orphaned
			buffers instead of in windows

	--search-wrap	Search wraps at end of file

	--smart-home	Home key first moves cursor to beginning of line,
			then if hit again, to first non-blank character.

	--rectangle	Turn on rectangular block mode.


 SECOND SECTION: Default file options
 Put each option you want set in the first column.
 File options can be specified as "Default file options" in this file
 and on the command line, or as "file options" on the command line.
 The command line options override those specified in this file.

	--auto-indent	Auto indent

	--lmargin=1	Left margin
	--rmargin=72	Right margin

	--overwrite	Overtype mode

	--read-only	File is read-only

	--word-wrap	Automatic word wrap


 THIRD SECTION: File name dependent options
 Each line with a non-whitespace character different from '-' in the
 first column indicates a file name regular expression (not to be
 confused with search/replace regular expressions).
 The options set in the lines following a group of regular expressions
 will be applied to the files whose name matches any of the regular
 expressions in the group. If more than one regular expression matches a
 file name, then the first matching one is chosen.
 The "file options" specified on the command line override those
 specified in this section.
